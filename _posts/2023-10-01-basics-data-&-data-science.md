### **Data**
### Define data
The word data means "information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making, or information in an electronic form that can be stored and used by a computer:"

### What is data?
Data plays an essential role in today's digital world. Every applications (apps, social media platform, IOT devices, etc.) store data in databases where the applications of raw data is in different formats such as numeric, text, images or videos.

In simple terms, data flows from a source to a destination.

### Data types
Data can be classified into two types: structured and unstructured. Structured data (quantitative) consists of numbers, while unstructured data (qualitative) consists of text as shown in below table.

Unlike structured data, unstructured data is less organised and difficult to search in databases. Unorganised raw data needs to be cleaned and processed to transform into organised useful information, which will provide businesses better insights into users. The data processes known as data analytics/data analysis will be discussed in subsequent part.

Furthermore, the acceleration of digitalisation implies an increase in the number of digital data being stored in databases. With a large amount of data generated daily, the greatest challenge is to manage data storage within the system which will learn more in detail later.

### Data Analytics or Data Analysis
![d4](https://github.com/cshiyun/cshiyun.github.io/assets/48885389/8998030c-f87d-4fcf-8709-4a310e7bb63b)

- Analytics uses statistics, data & machine learning to learn insights of data.

### Data analytics
Data analytics is a field that encompasses data analysis as well as data science and data engineering. There are three commonly used data analytics types for business decision-making:

- Descriptive analytics: what happened (key performance indicators, KPIs and performance metrics)
- Diagnostic analytics: why happened (anomalies)
- Predictive analytics: what will likely happen in the future (trends and predict)
- Prescriptive analytics: what needs to be done to achieve future outcomes.
- Cognitive analytics: how problem can be solved

### Data analytics process

### Data analysis
Data analysis processes involve the following:

1. Questions

Understand business problems and propose clear solutions
Identify data, key performance indicators or metrics to measure outcomes

2. Data collection
Quantitative (numerical) & Qualitative (categorical)
Data is collected from different sources, including research, surveys, interview, databases, etc which can be stored in database (SQL) or spreadsheet.

3. Data cleaning
Unstructured data includes incorrect spelling, duplicates, extra spacing or invalid fields.
It depends on data integrity to ensure accuracy and reliability of the data.

4. Data analysis
Example: Using Excel, SQL, Tableau, Python, R or Power BI, apply data mining techniques to identify patterns and trends.

5. Data visualization & storytelling
Prepare reports with charts and visuals
Communicate clear research findings to target users

## **Data Science**

### What is Data Science?
Data science is about extracting insights from raw data (structured and unstructured) for business decision-making known as data science pipeline.

As technology advances, data science applications can be found in various industries. A data science product (project) is maintained through a data science lifecycle to help answer questions and achieve business goals as shown below:

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are some of the tech terms that we most often hear today.

![d8](https://github.com/cshiyun/cshiyun.github.io/assets/48885389/35d2bf4f-1f75-4b68-835c-bb374556a13e)

- Artificial Intelligence uses computer science and datasets that enable systems to learn human-like behaviour.
- Machine Learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence techniques that help systems to extract information and learn from data.

### Machine Learning
There are two types of machine learning techniques as listed below:

Supervised learning
1. Classification (labelled data)
2. Regression (unlabelled data)

Unsupervised learning
1. Clustering (unlabelled data)
2. Anomaly detection (unlabelled data)
