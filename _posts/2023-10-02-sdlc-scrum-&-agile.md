### Introduction
With the rise of digitalisation around the world, businesses are leveraging technologies to continuous improvement the product in an iterative development. Not only it is important to keep up to date with the latest technology but also to enhance user (UIUX) experience. Digital products involve the product development process through software development practices, allowing digital products and services to deliver faster as well as high-quality products to meet users’ needs.

### **Software development life cycle**

Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a methodology used in product/project management that describes the software product creation process. One of the best methodologies is the “Agile” model as shown in the above diagram.
1. Requirement gathering
2. Analysis

The process involves planning, collaborating with stakeholders to identify business user needs and gather requirements for the system to address the problem.
- Identify problem statement
- Design the solution system

Requirement gathering describes the purpose of the system. Requirements are classified into four categories: functional, external & user interface, system features and non-functional. In this example, two common categories will be explained: functional requirements and non-functional. Functional requirements describe how a product behaves whereas non-functional requirements describe how a product should perform.

After gathering requirements, the expected software requirements are reviewed, approved and documented in the requirement specification (software requirement specification, user requirement specification or system requirement specification).

3. Design
This phase includes communicating business rules and application logic, followed by developing architecture, prototype and present in design document specification.

4. Develop
This phase includes developing products according to the design document specification.

5. Testing
Software testing involves from manual testing to automated testing. In this part, manual testing methods will further explain in detail below:

***Black box***: test system external behaviour
- Functional testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance testing
- Non-functional testing: performance, usability, security and compatibility testing
- Regression testing: ensure changes to software does not break existing system functionality

***White box***: test internal structure

***Grey box***: test combination of black box testing and white box testing
Code is tested through different types of software testing to identify any bugs, errors or missing requirements, ensuring smooth software performance to meet requirements.

6. Deployment
Final code software product will test in user acceptance testing before sign off and release to the production environment.

8. Maintenance
This phase includes gathering any feedback from end users’, identifying other issues (UI, etc.), code enhancement or new and changing requirements.

### **Scrum**
### **Agile methodology**

Scrum is an agile methodology framework that uses an iterative approach and breaks down complex projects into smaller manageable phases known as the “sprint” process. The goal is to deliver high-quality products quickly and efficiently while remaining responsive to end users’ needs as well as changing requirements easily.

The scrum team is made up of three main roles: Product owner, Scrum master and Development team.

Let’s dive into the scrum workflow in more detail to get a better understanding of agile development.
